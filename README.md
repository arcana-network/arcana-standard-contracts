# Arcana Standard Contracts

This project contains ERC standard contracts with Arcana supported functions.

*Need to add the purpose of this repository and why it is public. Who needs to use it and when.*

## AERC721 Contract

The AERC721 is a standard set of interfaces implemented by Arcana Protocol for issuing Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs residing on the Arcana Network.

It is fully compatible with the standard [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)) interface with just one execption. There is an additional hook method `_beforeTokenTransfer_`.

This additional hook method is added to setup communication with Arcana Network bridge contract. Bridge allows Arcana Network to listen for NFT mint/transfer on-chain operations that happen on the supported chains. Currently, Mumbai and Ropsten are supported.

## ⚙️ Installation

Install software dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 📚 Usage

After installation, you can deploy it to the supported chains and then customize it.

### Supported Chains

* [Polygon MUMBAI Testnet](https://docs.unbound.finance/guides/guide-to-accessing-polygon-testnet-and-how-to-use-unbound-faucet-tokens)
* [Ethereum Ropsten Testnet](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ropsten-testnet#ropsten-1)

### Deployment

#### MUMBAI Testnet

The contract in directly is ownable NFT collection i.e. Only deployer can mint the NFT.

**Environment Variables:**
- CONTRACT_OWNER : Contract deployer account having funds on Polygon MUMBAI network
MUMBAI_URL: Polygon Mumbai chain RPC URL
- NFT_COLLECTION_NAME : NFT collection name for marketplaces/explorer
- NFT_COLLECTION_SYMBOL: NFT collection symbol for marketplaces/explorer

In the project root directory, execute the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai

```

#### Other Chains

TBD - How to deploy instructions

### Customize NFT Contract

You can customize the NFT contract as per your needs. Make sure that you do not miss to include the `bridge call` in the contract. This call enables Arcana Network to listen for NFT transfers and record any ownership changes.

```ts

//outside contract defination
interface IBridge {
    function transferData(
        address _to,
        address _NFTContractAddress,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external;
}

//~~~~~~ snipped ~~~~~

function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) internal virtual override {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
        //for mumbai:  0x2a6137D49A5597aC3b26B7464Edf20A553291584
        //for ropsten : 0x491f0c066F6e126A34F57346613db5628B41ba18
        address bridgeContractAddress = "<bridge-address>";
        IBridge(bridgeContractAddress).transferData(to, address(this), tokenId);
}

```
